Here comes the joke
New Baby
For weeks a six-year old lad kept telling his first-grade teacher about the baby brother or sister that was expected at his house
One day the mother allowed the boy to feel the movements of the unborn child
The six-year old was obviously impressed
But made no comment
Furthermore
He stopped telling his teacher about the impending event
The teacher finally sat the boy on her lap and said
Tommy
Whatever has become of that baby brother or sister you were expecting at home
Tommy burst into tears and confessed
I think mommy ate it
