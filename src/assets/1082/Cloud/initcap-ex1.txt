recursion (adjective: recursive) occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic. the most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where a function being defined is applied within its own definition. while this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no infinite loop or infinite chain of references can occur.
